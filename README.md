# hello-world1
This is literally nothing but a test. You can continue on with your day, or you can help because honestly I'm still learning so...
So I'm a 16 year old dude, who wants to learn more about how to code. If anyone wants to collab with me, I'm not sure if there are ways of messaging me on here, so my Insta is @isiac_d. Probably shouldn't put that on here but whatever. What are you gonna do? 
(Just kinda realized that if you're experienced programmers you could probably find my house)
